Module 12 SQL Challenge Creating an Employee Tracker!

## Introduction

For this assignment, I had to attempt to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL/MySQL2.

## Criteria
To meet the Accepted Criteria of this assignment, I created an Employee Tracker using Inquirer and MySQL2:

When the application starts, the user is presented with the following options: View All Departments, View All Roles, View All Employees, Add a Department, Add a Role, Add an Employee, and Update An Employee Role.

When the user chooses to view all departments, they are presented with a formatted table showing department names and department ids.

When the user chooses to view all roles, they are presented with the job title, role id, the department that role belongs to, and the salary for that role.

When the user chooses to view all employees, they are presented with a formatted table showing employee data, including employee ids, first names, last names, job titles, departments, salaries, and managers that the employees report to.

When the user chooses to add a department, they are prompted to enter the name of the department and that department is added to the database.

When the user chooses to add a role, they are prompted to enter the name, salary, and department for the role.

## References

To complete this assignment I studied the following activities from the Module 12-SQL Class Activity Files as references:

"01-Ins_MySQL-Shell"

"03-Ins_Databases"

"11-Ins_Connect-Node"

"17-Ins_Seeds"

"19-Ins_Foreign-Primary-Key"

"21-Ins_Prepared-Statements"

"25-Ins_JOIN"

"28-Stu_Mini-Project"

After this, I searched the internet for further information and came across the following websites as references:

"https://github.com/ThomasCalle/Thomas-SQL-Employee-Tracker/blob/main/server.js"

"https://github.com/lenzlee/employee-tracker"

"https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_join.asp"

"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9CQxR0AfiQ"

The process of coding for me involved using code from the activities and websites mentioned above and commenting out every section of code in the server.js, and both SQL database (schema and seeds) files to see what each specific block of code accomplished.

This led to a lot of experimentation in order to see what I felt was needed to ultimately complete as much of the Accepted Criteria as possible.

The experimentation was necessary since it should be pointed out that while the code given inside the above referenced websites was very helpful, the code given DOES NOT completely accomplish everything that was asked for in the Acceptance Criteria for our specific assignment. It should also be noted that simply copying and pasting code without understanding what that code does will lead to more complications and a lack of understanding.
